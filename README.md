# dbVAST: database of Variations Associated with Shrimp Transcripts
dbVAST is available at: http://bioinfo.ciba.res.in/dbvast/

dbVAST is a database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in transcripts of three shrimp species, Penaeus indicus, Penaeus vannamei and Penaeus aztecus. Users can search the database with a query sequence and extract SNPs in it. The major components of dbVAST database are transcript sequences, blast annotations of transcript sequences against non-redundant protein sequences of GenBank and SNPs in transcript sequences. The dbVAST is intended to benefit researchers and academicians by showcasing variations in the candidate transcripts of shrimp.

Input

The dbVAST is a retrievable database of SNPs in transcript sequences. Users have to first select a shrimp species and then submit a query sequence in which he/she is interested to find SNP positions.

Output

A blastn search is performed for the query sequence against annotated transcripts of the database. The blastn search identifies the most similar annotated transcript in the database. Then the following information is displayed on screen which can be also be downloaded. 
•	The high quality SNPs in the transcript of database that is most similar to query sequence.
•	The blast statistics of the most similar transcript in database against non-redundant protein sequence database of GenBank &
•	The sequence of the most similar transcript in database.

Availability

The dbVAST is available free as on-line web tool for users.
